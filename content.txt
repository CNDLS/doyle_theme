        <p class="lead">How could we design a university for the future that would have liberal education values at its center but be appropriate for the world of 2030 and beyond?  What kind of student-centered university is possible right now that we could we only create at this moment?</p>

        <h4>Why are we doing this now?</h4>

        The forces enacting change upon higher education have been building. In a landscape shifted by globalization and technology, we face urgent questions of cost and value, quality, flexibility and relevance. 

        Rather than responding to these disruptions by narrowly focusing on preserving who we are, we must act with purpose and vision -- we must treat our future as a challenge of design, creativity and imagination.

        <h2>Why Georgetown?</h2>

        The work of the initiative – the discussions, the experiments – builds upon a 225-year tradition of excellence and innovation in teaching and learning. 

        In this new framework, we can better foster scholarship at the frontiers between disciplines.

        We can make higher education more accessible. 

        We can enrich our classrooms, and give our faculty the opportunity to share their expertise more broadly.   

        We can make a distinct contributions in determining how institutions of higher learning can meet the challenges and maximize the opportunities of this unique moment.
